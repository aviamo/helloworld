Hello World!

I am Avi, tour guide in Lisbon. I created this project to share local options for travellers in my city, to promote local commerce and preserve their existence!

Lisbon is going through a tourism boom that can be used to preserve its uniqueness!
Be like a local in Lisbon and support the city life!
